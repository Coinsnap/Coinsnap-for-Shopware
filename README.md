# Coinsnap for Shopware Payment Plugin

**Accept Bitcoin and Lightning payment in Shopware with Coinsnap**

Coinsnap is a Lightning Payment Provider and offers Bitcoin and Lightning payment processing for retail stores and online stores.
As a merchant, you only need a Lightning wallet with a Lightning address to receive Bitcoin and Lightning payments from your customers.

== Description ==

If you run a Shopware-based online store, integrating Bitcoin and Lightning payment options is easy with the Coinsnap Shopware plugin.

Simply install the Coinsnap Shopware plugin on Shopware version 6 or higher, link it to your Coinsnap account, and your customers will have the option to pay with Bitcoin and Lightning.

All incoming Bitcoin payments are immediately forwarded and added to your Lightning Wallet. The Coinsnap Shopware plugin, developed by Coincharge, is compatible with both BTCPay Server and Coinsnap for connectivity.

In addition to the standard payment options, Bitcoin and Lightning payment methods are also listed here, which are highlighted in blue when activated. You have the option of displaying the Bitcoin and Lightning payment methods separately or as a joint payment method. We recommend using it as a common payment method.

The end customer is then shown a QR code containing both Bitcoin and Lightning.
Regardless of whether the user uses a Lightning or a Bitcoin wallet, payment is possible and unwanted terminations can be avoided.

Individual configurations can be made using the “Edit details” option. This can be used to change the display for the payer, e.g. to “Bitcoin” in our example.

The order of the payment methods displayed, the descriptive text and the associated logo can also be customized. It is recommended to activate the function “Allow change of payment method after completion of the order”.

If someone chooses Bitcoin as a payment method but later decides against it, they can easily switch to another option.

### Shopware sales channel settings ###

Within the sales channel, the configuration options for payment and shipping can be found under General basic settings, followed by Payment methods.

Here you can select Bitcoin and Lightning as your payment method. As soon as this is done, these payment methods are activated and can be used in the store.
